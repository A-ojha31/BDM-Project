# BDM-Project in Healthcare
Context This repository showcases my work for the capstone project under the Business Data Management (BDM) course, part of the Diploma in Data Science program at IIT Madras. The project involves analyzing primary data from a medical diagnostic center in Ghana to identify operational and strategic insights for business expansion.

Overview:
The project was based on primary data obtained from a medical diagnostic center operating in Ghana, Africa. The company currently runs multiple branches across the country and has plans to expand to several additional locations. It is currently operating as a profit-making enterprise and aims to further increase its profitability through strategic expansion. Based on these details and discussions with a company representative, three key problem statements were identified for the project.

Analysis Tools and Justification:
Excel is chosen as the primary tool due to its range of analysis, visualization, and filtering features:
  1. Data Visualization: Excel’s charting capabilities will help visually highlight patterns, making trend insights easily interpretable.
  2. Pivot Tables: For segmentation by location and test type, pivot tables in Excel allow for efficient summarization and comparison.
  3. Formula-Based Analysis: Custom formulas in Excel will enable correlation analysis between demographics and test preferences, guiding personalized recommendations for service improvement.

Problem Statements:
  1.  Analyze patient test patterns over the past three years to identify trends, peak periods, and common tests to enhance inventory management.
  2.  Investigate service demand and patient flow across current locations to inform better resource allocation.
  3.  Identify gaps in patient demographic data to tailor services and improve healthcare delivery across centers.

Data Dump:
The data received comprised patient records spanning three years, provided as separate Excel files. Each file contained information from multiple diagnostic centers, including details on tests conducted, associated costs, and patient profiles. To enable consistent analysis, the data from all sources was collated and consolidated into a single master sheet, forming a unified repository for further processing.

Meta data:
➔ Time Period: January 2022 – August 2024
➔ Total Records: 1,02,183
  ● 2022: 32,919 rows
  ● 2023: 41,635 rows
  ● 2024 (till August): 27,629 rows
➔ Data Coverage:
  ● Key Fields: Patient ID, Age, Gender, Test Type, Test Cost, Location, Date of Visit
  ● Centers Included: 3 Centers
➔ Data Consistency: Identical column structure across all sheets.
➔ Size Distribution: Monthly records ranging from ~2,500 to ~4,000 rows per sheet.
